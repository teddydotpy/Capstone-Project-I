# Capstone-Project-I

This project is technically called the second capstone project in my data science course but
it is the first one that i uploaded so there's that. In this project I had do an exploratory
analysis on a data set called Automobile where I explored the different information
based on different car's specifications. These cars have the columns 
['symboling', 'normalized-losses', 'make', 'fuel-type', 'aspiration',
'num-of-doors', 'body-style', 'drive-wheels', 'engine-location',
'wheel-base', 'length', 'width', 'height', 'curb-weight', 'engine-type',
'num-of-cylinders', 'engine-size', 'fuel-system', 'bore', 'stroke',
'compression-ratio', 'horsepower', 'peak-rpm', 'city-mpg', 'highway-mpg', 'price']
